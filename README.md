The Protected Areas are recognized as an effective tool in 
conserving biodiversity and ecosystems. The Red List of 
Threatened Species (World Conservation Union-IUCN) 
documents that the loss of natural habitats is a 
predominant threat to biodiversity, and protected areas are 
widely regarded as one of the most successful measures 
implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. 
Currently, the World Database on Protected Areas has 
documented 148,000 protected areas worldwide (IUCN, 
2013). 
Pakistan has three categories of protected areas: National 
Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Game Reserves (Khan et 
al., 
2010). The Khirthar Protected Areas Complex 
(KPAC) stretches over 4,350 km2, encompassing the 
protected areas (PAs) that lie in Kohistan in the southwest 
of Sindh. The KPAC comprises of Khirthar National Park 
(KNP), the Mahal Kohistan Wildlife Sanctuary (MKS), 
Hab Dam Wildlife Sanctuary (HDS), the Surjan, Sumbak, 
Eri, and Hothiano Game Reserves (SGR). Khirthar 
National Park is listed as a Protected Category II area by 
the IUCN, and is the first of Pakistan's national parks to 
be included in the 1975 United Nation's list of National 
Parks and Equivalent Reserves. 



Khirthar National Park (KNP)  
Khirthar National Park is one of Pakistan’s largest 
National Park on area of 308,733 hectares. It was 
established in 1974 for conservation of threatened 
mammal species such as Sindh Ibex (Capra aegagrus), 
Urial (Ovis vignei), Chinkara (Gazella bennettii) and 
indigenous flora and fauna. Several other species like 
Desert wolf, Leopard, Striped hyaena, Desert wolf, Jungle 
cats, Porcupine and Pangolin are also resident of this park 
(Roberts, 1997).  
 
It was the first park incorporated in the listing system of 
Uniter Nation`s National Parks in 1975 (Khan et al., 
2013). Hot spots of vertebrate wildlife are found in 
croplands and wetlands while lowest in mountain areas. 
Total 277 vertebrate species were found including 36 
species of mammals (Table 6a, 6b), 207 species of birds 
(Table 7), 42 species of reptiles (Table 8) and three 
species of amphibians (Table 9). 
 
In the Khirthar National Park highest vertebrate wildlife is 
found in wetlands and croplands and the lowest in moutain sites. 
The formland area observed relatively less importance to several of the rarer species. Khirthar 
National Park (3087km2) is part of the Khirthar Protected 
Areas Complex (KPAC) that stretches over 4350km2 and 
comprises of Mahal Kohistan Wildlife Sanctuary (705.7 
km2), Surjan Game Reserve, Sambak Game Reserve, Eri 
Game Reserve, Huthiano Game Reserve (285.3km2) and 
Hub Dam Wildlife Sanctuary (272km2) (Khan et al., 
2013). Due to the presence of several threatened species, 
such as: Imperial Eagle, Pallas’s Fishing Eagle, 
Dalmatian Pelican, Sociable Lapwing, Indian Skimmer 
and Great White Pelican Khirthar National Park and Hub 
Dam are included as Important Bird Area (IBAs) (Khan et 
al., 2012).

Report of Haleji


Introduction:
A wetland is a type of ecosystem that is characterized by the presence of water at or near the surface of the ground for a significant part of the year. Wetlands possess ecological values for many plants, animals, birds, and human beings, including threatened and endangered species. These are important sources for storing floodwater, rainwater and runoff. These areas are typically rich in biodiversity and support a variety of plant and animal species that are specially adapted to living in wet conditions.
Pakistan has important and unique wetlands, which supports a wide range of globally important biological diversity, serving as habitat for endangered and native animals, and acting as crucial staging and breeding areas for migratory bird populations, including globally threatened species, using the Central Asian Flyways [12]. It is reported that there are 225 sites of wetland and lakes with a total surface area of about 9.7% of Pakistan. Out of these, nineteen numbers are Ramsar sites with an area of 1,343,627 hectares. 
 Overview of Halaji lake:
 Haleji wetland is one of the Ramsar sites located at a distance of about 15 km northwest of Thatta city and 85 km east of Karachi. This is a waterfowl sanctuary and a birdwatcher's paradise. A 5 km track leads to the Lake from National Highway and take a 10 km circumferential drive of wetland. It cover an area of about 1704 hectares at an elevation of 60 m from sea level. The area is silty, muddy, and sandy. It is a large fresh water body, characteristic for the Sindh province of Pakistan.
 It was originally a salt-water lake, formed by seasonal water, collecting in a depression. During World War II, additional water was required for troops stationed at Karachi. Salt water was drained out and an embankment was constructed around the lake, which was fed by fresh water through irrigated canal system. As a result, Haleji became one of the major sources of water supply to the increasing population of Karachi.
Home for migratory and indigenous birds:
This water reservoir is home to Siberian migratory birds from November till February. It is bird’s lover paradise in the winter months. During the winter, migratory birds visit to this lake in very large numbers to the great delight of the bird watchers.
 Halaji Lake supports a very diverse fauna and flora, including several threatened species, and is one of the most important breeding, staging and wintering areas for waterfowl in Sindh, regularly holding between 50,000 to 100,000 birds. Halaji Lake became first protected area as a game sanctuary in 1971 and it was declared wildlife sanctuary in 1997. The site was visited by Ramsar Advisory in 1990. The mission recommended that there is a very serious threat to the ecology of the Halaji wetland.
Mammalian fauna of Halaji lake:
Although Halaji Lake is more famous for its avian diversity, especially migratory birds, the surrounding wetlands and grasslands also support a variety of mammal species. A total of six species recorded as they key species of mammals in Haleji Lake.
                         
No	Common Name 	Scientific Name 
 1	Indian Fox	Vulpes benglensis

 2	Fishing Cat	Prionailurus viverrinus
 3	Desert Hare	Lepus nigricollis
 4	Small Indian Civet	Viverricula indica
 5	Jungle Cat	Felis chaus
 6	Smooth Coated- Otter	chauLutrogale perspicillata

Bird fauna of Halaji lake:	
Halaji Lake is an important stopover for migratory birds, particularly those following the Central Asian Flyway a key migratory route for birds traveling between Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia.
The common birds of the area are Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus), Little Cormorant (Phalacorcorax niger), Purple Moorhen (Porphyrio porphyrio), Indian Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), Long-legged Buzzard (Buteo rufinus), Coot (Fulica atra), Little Grebe/Dabchick (Tachybaptus ruficollis), Tufted Duck (Aythya ferina), Pied Wagtail (Motacilla alba), Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla flava), Black Drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus), Pied Bush Chat (Saxicola caprata), Sand Martin (Riparia paludicola) and Wire-tailed Swallow (Hirundo smithi).
Repite fauna of Halaje lake:
Among reptiles, Indian Garden Lizard (Calotes versicolor), Indian Fringe-toed Lizard (Acanthodactylus cantoris), Glossy Bellied Racer (Platyceps ventromaculatus) and Yellow-bellied House Gecko (Hemidactylus flaviviridis) are common.
The key species of the area include; Indian Monitor (Varanus bengalensis), Desert Monitor (Varanus griseus), and Spiny-tailed Lizard (Saara hardwickii), while Marsh Crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) is a threatened species of the area.
Amphibian fauna of Halaje laka:
Skittering Frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) and Indus Toad (Duttaphrynus stomaticus) are commonly found.
Fish fauna of Halaje lake:
A total of 49 species of fishes have been recorded from the lake. Out of these, 10 species have very high commercial value such as Mori (Cirrhinus mrigala), Thaila (Gibelion catla), Rohu (Labeo rohita), Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio), Singhari (Sperata sarwari), Fauji Khagga (Bagarius bagarius), Malli (Wallago attu), Thalli (Clupisoma garua), Thalli (Clupisoma naziri) and Soul (Channa marulias). At the present time, the numbers of these food fishes have drastically declined in the lake and now only Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) is found in abundance.
Conclusions:
Halaji lake biodiversity faced severed challenges that threaten its ecological balance and long-term sustainability. These problems are primarily driven by human activities, environmental changes, and mismanagement of natural resources. So following initiatives should be taken
⦁	Effective enforcement of the legal protections under the Ramsar Convention and local laws is essential. This includes monitoring and preventing illegal activities such as habitat destruction, and over-extraction of resources.
⦁	Establish buffer zones around the lake to prevent encroachment and development activities. These zones should have strict land-use regulations to protect the surrounding environment from urbanization, agriculture, and industrial activities.
⦁	In areas where the wetland ecosystem has been degraded restoration projects should be initiated. This may include efforts to rehabilitate vegetation, reintroduce native species, and restore water flow patterns to enhance the wetland’s ecological functions
⦁	Halaji Lake depends on seasonal rainfall and groundwater for its water supply. Effective water management is crucial to maintain the lake’s ecological health.
⦁	Local communities should be actively involved in conservation efforts, educate them and gave handsome incentives for their constructive role.
⦁	Climate change poses a growing threat to the wetland ecosystem, including changes in water levels, increased temperature, and altered rainfall patterns. Monitoring these changes and developing climate adaptation strategies can help manage the effects on biodiversity.
