The Protected Areas are recognized as an effective tool in 
conserving biodiversity and ecosystems. The Red List of 
Threatened Species (World Conservation Union-IUCN) 
documents that the loss of natural habitats is a 
predominant threat to biodiversity, and protected areas are 
widely regarded as one of the most successful measures 
implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. 
Currently, the World Database on Protected Areas has 
documented 148,000 protected areas worldwide (IUCN, 
2013). 
Pakistan has three categories of protected areas: National 
Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Game Reserves (Khan et 
al., 
2010). The Khirthar Protected Areas Complex 
(KPAC) stretches over 4,350 km2, encompassing the 
protected areas (PAs) that lie in Kohistan in the southwest 
of Sindh. The KPAC comprises of Khirthar National Park 
(KNP), the Mahal Kohistan Wildlife Sanctuary (MKS), 
Hab Dam Wildlife Sanctuary (HDS), the Surjan, Sumbak, 
Eri, and Hothiano Game Reserves (SGR). Khirthar 
National Park is listed as a Protected Category II area by 
the IUCN, and is the first of Pakistan's national parks to 
be included in the 1975 United Nation's list of National 
Parks and Equivalent Reserves. 



Khirthar National Park (KNP)  
Khirthar National Park is one of Pakistan’s largest 
National Park on area of 308,733 hectares. It was 
established in 1974 for conservation of threatened 
mammal species such as Sindh Ibex (Capra aegagrus), 
Urial (Ovis vignei), Chinkara (Gazella bennettii) and 
indigenous flora and fauna. Several other species like 
Desert wolf, Leopard, Striped hyaena, Desert wolf, Jungle 
cats, Porcupine and Pangolin are also resident of this park 
(Roberts, 1997).  
 
It was the first park incorporated in the listing system of 
Uniter Nation`s National Parks in 1975 (Khan et al., 
2013). Hot spots of vertebrate wildlife are found in 
croplands and wetlands while lowest in mountain areas. 
Total 277 vertebrate species were found including 36 
species of mammals (Table 6a, 6b), 207 species of birds 
(Table 7), 42 species of reptiles (Table 8) and three 
species of amphibians (Table 9). 
 
In the Khirthar National Park highest vertebrate wildlife is 
found in wetlands and croplands and the lowest in moutain sites. 
The formland area observed relatively less importance to several of the rarer species. Khirthar 
National Park (3087km2) is part of the Khirthar Protected 
Areas Complex (KPAC) that stretches over 4350km2 and 
comprises of Mahal Kohistan Wildlife Sanctuary (705.7 
km2), Surjan Game Reserve, Sambak Game Reserve, Eri 
Game Reserve, Huthiano Game Reserve (285.3km2) and 
Hub Dam Wildlife Sanctuary (272km2) (Khan et al., 
2013). Due to the presence of several threatened species, 
such as: Imperial Eagle, Pallas’s Fishing Eagle, 
Dalmatian Pelican, Sociable Lapwing, Indian Skimmer 
and Great White Pelican Khirthar National Park and Hub 
Dam are included as Important Bird Area (IBAs) (Khan et 
al., 2012).
